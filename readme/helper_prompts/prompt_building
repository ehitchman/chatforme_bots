I've got a chat bot i'm building using chatgpt as the primary content generator.  I'd like some help with a problem I'm facing. 

Objective: start a story, develop a story, end a story.  
Problem: Ending the story

The app starts by retrieving a news article from an RSS news feed.  It feeds this into chatgpt to generate a plot for a new story.

With this [story] along with a [prompt] designed to give storytelling conditions and tips (e.g. 25 words per contribution, maximum 200 words, language style, etc.)   an output is 

[prompt]:
"Extend the story by contributing a single thought in the form of an addition  to the screenplay based on the scripts history. Aim for a coherent and smooth  flow with previous messages but feel free to close and complete a topic of  conversation.  If a topic of conversation has completed, start a new one.  The text contribution/response should be less than 200 characters long.
Conditions:
  - The text contribution/response from you should be 10-21 words long
  - The text contribution/response should be less than 200 characters long.
  - Only add one response/thought/addition as your contribution.
  - Do not prefix your messages with any username or handle, ie. <<<[username]>>>.
  - Avoid repetition in your contributions.

Language Style: News/fact-based/storytelling.  Make sure the story progresses and individual plot items come to a conclusion
Themes and Elements to Incorporate:
  - Current Events: Use themes or elements from the summary plot below as catalysts for the stories development.
  - Characters: The story involves 2+ characters wrestling with a central dilemma, which evolves as more information becomes available.
  - Dialogue: Incorporate dialogue to add depth, especially if previous contributions lack it.
  - Plot Twists: Introduce a new element or revelation from the RSS feed to complicate the problem and increase tension.
  - Imagery: Balance vivid imagery and plot. If prior lines are heavy in imagery, pivot to action or dialogue.

Handling Conflicts or Inconsistencies:
  - Resolve discrepancies through metaphors or allegories, aiming for integration while increasing poetic depth.

Ending the Story or Transitioning:
  - Conclude the story arc with compelling impact, or introduce a recurring symbol from the plot to signal a transition.

[story]:
- Twin brothers Ashton and Michael Kutcher, who have a bond but also a rift, are the central characters
- Ashton Kutcher battles with the autoimmune condition vasculitis
- Dr. David Agus, Ashton's doctor, plays a significant role in the story
- Michael Kutcher has cerebral palsy, adding another layer of complexity to the plot
- The brothers discuss Michael's near-death experience as a child due to viral myocarditis
- The story explores their relationship dynamics and how they navigate their individual struggles
- It delves into themes of family, resilience, and overcoming obstacles
- The movie/sitcom offers a mix of emotions, from heartwarming moments to tense conflicts
- It highlights the importance of support and understanding in dealing with health issues and family differences
- The story aims to inspire and educate audiences about the challenges and triumphs of living with chronic illnesses."

Here is an example of the first output.  It shows that the bot begins to tell a story:
"Ashton stares at the computer screen, reading about a breakthrough treatment for vasculitis."

From here, that message is fed back to the bot, along with the prompt (the prompt tells chatGPT to continue to tell the story, 25 words at a time.)  This is working well.  Here's an example of a followup message:
"Ashton's heart races with excitement as he realizes the breakthrough treatment could finally bring him relief."

From here, the story keeps going.  As you can see my problem si that the story never ends.  I'm looking for a way to cycle the chatbot through a separate control flow so that it can tell the bot to send one more message to conclude the story.  beyond the python control flow suggestions, I'd need a prompt for this.

Put together some pseudo-python code that takes this scenario in mind and plots out the control flow

Some additional information:
-  a "while true" loop runs to have the bot continually send one message at a time
- an existing start_story() function begins the story, an exsiting stop_story() function ends the "while true" so I imagine that fucntion would need to be called after the final message to conclude the story is sent by the chatbot (via chatgpt as the content creator)

To refactor and improve your Python code, consider the following best practices:
Most Important: Function Decomposition
The single most important step you can take to improve this code is to break it down into smaller, reusable functions. This approach is particularly beneficial for data engineering and development work.
For example:
•	A function to load YAML files: load_config('config.yaml')
•	A function to set the runtime parameters: set_runtime_parameters()
•	A function for printing debug information: print_debug_info()
•	A function to generate prompts: generate_prompt(prompt_type)
•	A function for the main async logic: main_loop()
pythonCopy code
async def send_periodic_message(self): self.load_config('config.yaml') self.set_runtime_parameters() self.print_debug_info() if not self.check_bot_activation(): return channel = self.get_channel(self.TWITCH_BOT_CHANNEL_NAME) while True: if not self.is_loop_active: await asyncio.sleep(5) continue gpt_prompt_final = self.generate_prompt('ouat') generated_message = self.get_generated_message(gpt_prompt_final) if generated_message: await channel.send(generated_message) await self.play_sound_if_needed(generated_message) await asyncio.sleep(int(self.automated_message_seconds)) 
Other Important Best Practices
1.	Configuration Management: Keep your API keys and other sensitive data out of the codebase. Use environment variables or separate config files.
2.	Error Handling: Use try-except blocks judiciously and handle specific exceptions wherever possible. Also, consider using logging instead of print statements for better error tracking.
3.	Constants: Use ALL_CAPS for constant values.
4.	Comments and Documentation: Use comments to describe the why, not the what. Also, consider using docstrings for functions.
5.	Variable Naming: Use meaningful variable names. It's better to have a long descriptive name than a short, unclear one.
6.	Clean Code: Remove commented-out code if it's not being used.
I hope these tips help you make your code more modular and maintainable, Optimus. Would you like to dive deeper into any of these best practices?
